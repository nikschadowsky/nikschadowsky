### Hey you! I'm Nik SchadowskyðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergrad in Computer Science and in my freetime I get lost in the world of my projects. 

I mainly program in Java but I love to expand my knowledge by using different technologies and programming languages.

#### About my projects

Yes I know. My projects seem weird, random and insane. But I like that. 

You can find them either under the [repositories](https://github.com/nikschadowsky?tab=repositories) tab or on my website [nikschadowsky.de](https://nikschadowsky.de) (currently only in German).
